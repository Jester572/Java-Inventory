# Overview

The purpose of me writing this code is to learn about Java and experiment with what I can accomplish using it. This is my first bit of Java and am trying to progress in learning about many different programming language and how they all work.

This software creates a basic inventory system. Although it does not have the capabilitlities of saving the data, it does have the ability to edit information and items that may need to be changed

I wrote this program becasue I wanted to try my hand at object oriented programming. I found that this program helped me understand the importance of Classes and subclasses and how they work together.

# Development Environment

IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.3.1

This program was developed using Java. The only library I used was java.util.Scanner.

# Future Work


- I would like to be able to delete items from the inventory.
- Make it more readable. Possibly add a GUI.
- Create a more identifiable ID number between software and items.
